# Privacy on StarkNet

By default, Starknet transactions and their payloads are visible to the network in the same way that they are visible on Ethereum. It would be more appropriate to call StarkNet a validity rollup rather than zk-rollup.
However, it is possible to deploy various privacy protocols on StarkNet, which will offer full privacy from all network participants.

The research tries to explore the possibilities of creating verifiable proofs of the correct execution of a computation using STARK
